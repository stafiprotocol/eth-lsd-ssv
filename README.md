# eth-lsd-ssv

SSV.network is a decentralized ETH staking network enabling the distributed operation of an Ethereum validator. The network allows validators to diversify staking risks, optimize performance, and promote decentralization across the Ethereum consensus layer.

LSD SSV service automatically creates new validators if user pool have enough funds and distributed it to SSV.network through its contracts. You will benefit by not operating your own validator nodes.
